### General and API Settings
- **api**: Configuration for the miner's API for statistics and monitoring.
  - **id**: Identifier for the API instance.
  - **worker-id**: Identifier for the worker, useful for tracking multiple miners.

- **http**: Settings related to the HTTP API for remote monitoring.
  - **enabled**: Whether the HTTP server is enabled (false in your config, meaning it's disabled).
  - **host**: Host address for the HTTP server.
  - **port**: Port for the HTTP server; set to 0, which usually means the feature is disabled or not set.
  - **access-token**: Token for accessing the HTTP API, not set in your config.
  - **restricted**: If true, restricts the access to the monitoring API.

- **autosave**: Automatically saves the configuration to the file when changes are made.
- **background**: Whether to run the miner in the background.
- **colors**: Enable colored output in the console.
- **title**: Set the console window title to reflect the miner status.

### RandomX Specific Settings
- **randomx**: Configuration specific to the RandomX algorithm.
  - **init**: Number of initialization threads for RandomX (-1 means automatic).
  - **init-avx2**: Number of initialization threads for RandomX using AVX2 instructions (-1 means automatic).
  - **mode**: Mining mode, set to auto to let XMRig choose the best mode.
  - **1gb-pages**: Whether to use 1GB hugepages, which can improve performance if supported and properly configured.
  - **rdmsr**: Whether to read from model-specific registers (can boost performance but requires admin rights).
  - **wrmsr**: Whether to write to model-specific registers (similarly, can boost performance but risky).
  - **cache_qos**: If true, utilizes cache QoS features available in newer CPUs.
  - **numa**: Enables NUMA support, crucial for performance on multi-socket systems.
  - **scratchpad_prefetch_mode**: Sets the prefetch mode for the RandomX scratchpad.

### CPU Settings
- **cpu**: Configuration for CPU mining specifics.
  - **enabled**: Whether CPU mining is enabled.
  - **huge-pages**: Use of large/huge memory pages to improve mining performance.
  - **huge-pages-jit**: Just-in-Time compilation for huge pages.
  - **hw-aes**: Hardware AES support (null means auto-detect).
  - **priority**: Priority of the mining process (null means default).
  - **memory-pool**: Whether to use a shared memory pool for threads.
  - **yield**: If true, makes the miner yield CPU time to other processes.
  - **asm**: Use optimized assembly code for mining (true for better performance).
  - **threads**: Number of mining threads.
  - **msr**: Model-specific register setup (-1 means default).
  - **argon2-impl**: Implementation of Argon2 to use (null means default).

### Cryptonight Algorithm Settings
- **cn**, **cn-heavy**, **cn-lite**, **cn-pico**, etc.: Configurations for different variations of the Cryptonight algorithm, detailing thread and memory usage configurations.

### Other Configurations
- **opencl** and **cuda**: Settings for GPU mining using OpenCL (for AMD GPUs) and CUDA (for Nvidia GPUs), respectively. These are disabled in your configuration.

- **pools**: Configuration of the mining pools.
  - **url**: Address of the mining pool.
  - **user**: Your Monero wallet address.
  - **pass**: Password for the mining pool, if required.
  - **keepalive**: Whether to send keepalive packets for the connection.
  - **tls**: Use TLS/SSL for a secure connection to the pool.

- **log-file**: Path to the log file.
- **donate-level**: Percentage of mining time donated to the software's developer.
- **retries**, **retry-pause**: Settings for how the miner should handle retries if the connection to the pool fails.

### Security and Network Settings
- **tls**: Settings for TLS/SSL if enabled.
- **dns**: DNS configuration settings.
- **user-agent**: Custom user-agent string for pool connections.
- **verbose**: Level of verbosity in the log output.
- **watch**: Whether to watch the config file for changes.
